  <Prose>
    <Lead>An institution slowed down by technical debt.</Lead>

    The Freie Evangelische Schule Kirchheim (FESK) provides excellent education, but its digital presence did not reflect this quality. The legacy system was plagued by high operational costs, slow load times, and a complex admin interface that frustrated staff.

    The most critical technical bottleneck was a <Highlight>5-second cold boot time</Highlight>, which led to high bounce rates. Parents looking to register their children faced a confusing UI, and the school's visibility in search engines was suboptimal.

    To architect a cost-effective, scalable, and inclusive digital ecosystem that empowers the administration and welcomes new families.

  <Lead>Clean Code Principles meets Modern Web Performance.</Lead>

  <Prose>
    To solve the performance issues, I migrated the architecture to <Highlight>Next.js 16</Highlight>. The move allowed us to leverage <Highlight>Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</Highlight> and <Highlight>Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)</Highlight>, eliminating the cold boot issue entirely.

  <Subheading>Applying Clean Code</Subheading>

  <Prose>
    As this project relies on voluntary maintenance, code readability was paramount. I enforced <Highlight>Uncle Bob's Clean Code standards</Highlight>:

  <Lead>"Digital Sovereignty restored."</Lead>

  <Prose>
    This project was more than a redesign; it was a restructuring of how the school presents itself digitally. By cutting technical costs by a factor of 2.5 and tripling search impressions, we proved that high-end engineering directly translates to institutional success.
