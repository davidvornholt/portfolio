# 01 The Challenge

## An institution slowed down by technical debt.

The Freie Evangelische Schule Kirchheim (FESK) provides excellent education, but its digital presence did not reflect this quality. The legacy system was plagued by high operational costs, slow load times, and a complex admin interface that frustrated staff.

The most critical technical bottleneck was a **5-second cold boot time**, which led to high bounce rates. Parents looking to register their children faced a confusing UI, and the school's visibility in search engines was suboptimal.

<Callout title="My Mission:">
  To architect a cost-effective, scalable, and inclusive digital ecosystem that empowers the administration and welcomes new families.

# 03 Architecture & Engineering

## Clean Code Principles meets Modern Web Performance.

To solve the performance issues, I migrated the architecture to **Next.js 16**. The move allowed us to leverage **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**, eliminating the cold boot issue entirely.

### Applying Clean Code

As this project relies on voluntary maintenance, code readability was paramount. I enforced **Uncle Bob's Clean Code standards**:

  <CheckItem title="Strict Typing" description="A comprehensive TypeScript schema ensures that 95% of potential runtime errors are caught at compile time." />
  <CheckItem title="Component Composition" description="Instead of monolithic page files, the UI is built from atomic, reusable components (Atomic Design)." />
  <CheckItem title="Separation of Concerns" description="Business logic is strictly separated from the UI layer via custom hooks." />

# 04 User Experience & Accessibility

## Building for the Community.

A school website must be accessible to everyone—grandparents on older tablets, parents on mobile data, and users with visual impairments.

# 05 The Verdict

## "Digital Sovereignty restored."

This project was more than a redesign; it was a restructuring of how the school presents itself digitally. By cutting technical costs by a factor of 2.5 and tripling search impressions, we proved that high-end engineering directly translates to institutional success.
